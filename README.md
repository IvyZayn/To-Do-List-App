# Run the project locally

If you want to render the app locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies by node
npm install 

# Start a development server
nodemon app.js

```

Once the job completes, the application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Create a new list

When the application is running, you can create a new list by visiting `http://localhost:3000` + `/listName`. e.g. create a work list by visiting `http://localhost:3000/work`.
